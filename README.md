# Java Messaging System

***1st Year Computer Science Project at the University of Birmingham***

A multi-threaded messaging system in Java featuring a client-server model.

The system has the following functionality alongside sending and receiving messages:

- Register
- Login
- Logout
- Keep all messages received by any user
- Allow user to move from current message to previous or next, or delete current message.
- Save all users' messages to a file when the server is shut down, and when restarted to read from this file (to achieve this I also added console input and checking for unseen messages while a user was logged out)
