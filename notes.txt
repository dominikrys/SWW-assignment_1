disallow nicknames like "quit" "server" or "", possibly ignore cases?
remove all redundant imports and variables and methods
solution md server checking if stuff logged in
maybe add messaged to send back to user
try sendservermessage when stuff isn't working and explain in solution md
add nickname exclusions - blanks etc, possibly excluse capitals
see if i can optimise quitting etc
keep construcors consistent i.e. _value
clean up directory
make hashmaps generic i.e. map = hashmap
general testing
necessary to initialize arraylist if it's being set to an existing one??
add extra methods to better handle repeated tasks
switch null mention jls
added running flags to break the switch statements
thought about messageStore storing hashmaps to tell which one is current but that would be too much effort to access, not worth it
take last currentmessage is fone is being tracked down 
hashmap to disallow duplicate names
when send is called set that message to the current one
if recipeint != null = check if stream closes back in
for delete command, say previous > next > none
disallow registering and sending to blocked clients
dont have to disallow quit
if a user logs back in, display all its missed messages
allow closing by pressing cross
solution md no "message sent"
ignore cases
